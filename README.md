# JavaScript-Data-Structures (Implementing data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs using JavaScript.)

* Big O Notation: Analyze your codeâ€™s time and space complexity using Big O notation.
* Sorting Algorithm: Different sorting algorithms - Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort. 
* Searching algorithms such as binary search.
* JavaScript implementation of linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.
* Tree traversial, graphs [such as mapping GPS data, storing social network data], and Dijkstra's Shortest Path.
* Dynamic Programming.
* Probems solving patterns: 
    1. Divide & Conquer
    2. Sliding windows
    3. Frequency counter patterns
